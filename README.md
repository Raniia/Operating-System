# Operating-System
Project Objective
In this project, you are expected to build a tiny yet functional operating system
similar to CP/M 1 from scratch. The operating system that you will implement is
intended to fit on a 3 1/2 inch floppy disk, and to be bootable on any normal x86
PC. The operating system is to be programmed primarily in C with a small amount
of assembly functions. It contains no externally written functions or libraries; all
the code is written exclusively for this project.
